Combining portfolio Theory with Programming.  Interested in creating price series
objects that can be combined with each other at varying weights to compute
observed returns and variance with would be portfolios.

Will be adding Pearson correlations for returns to explore hedging strategies.
Measuring hedge effectiveness by increases in Sharpe ratio.

Just a project for my programming portfolio, not putting my life savings in
anything but an low cost traditional index fund in the foreseeable future:D
